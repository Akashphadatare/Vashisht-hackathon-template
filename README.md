## Problem statement 
Enhancing Crop Yield Prediction Accuracy Through Region-Specific Models
## About the project
The primary aim is to develop highly accurate crop yield prediction models tailored to the specific characteristics of individual agricultural regions. By shifting the focus from broad-scale approaches to region-specific models, the goal is to provide farmers with precise forecasts that reflect the nuanced conditions of their local environment. This approach holds the potential to empower farmers with actionable insights for optimizing agricultural practices and improving productivity.

## Technical implemntaion 
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gathered region-specific data on weather, soil, and crop yields.
Preprocessed data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Model Development:
Utilized MLR algorithms and ensemble techniques.
Conducted cross-validation to select the best-performing models.
Region-Specific Model Training:
Divided dataset into region-specific subsets.
Trained MLR models for each region, optimizing hyperparameters.
Evaluation and Validation:
Evaluated model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared score.
Conducted validation tests for generalization.
