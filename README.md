## Problem statement 
In we are using only for the specific region but in the existing process are only taking the whole contry or state as per that the accurace of the model not perfect as compared to our project, we are proposing this solution as it can be more accurate and also it can be for a specific region  , farmers are facing more problems because of previous models as the are taking the country wise the the specific region farmers are following the same and they are getting affected.
## About the project
By leveraging historical data, weather patterns, and other relevant variables, the aim is to create a robust and accurate predictive model that can assist farmers and stakeholders in making informed decisions related to crop management, resource allocation, and market planning.
