- Our prototype develops region-specific machine learning regression (MLR) models for predicting crop yields, addressing the limitations of generalized models. It utilizes a dataset with region-specific data on weather, soil, and crops.
- Prototype Functionality:
- Region-Specific Model Development: Trains MLR models tailored to each region, capturing local environmental and agricultural factors.
- Prediction Accuracy Enhancement: Improves accuracy by focusing on specific regions, providing precise forecasts aligned with local conditions.
- User-Friendly Interface: Offers an intuitive interface for farmers to input data and obtain accurate yield predictions.
- Integration with Agricultural Systems: Seamlessly integrates with existing systems, enabling farmers to optimize practices based on region-specific insights.

## Problem statement 
Enhancing Crop Yield Prediction Accuracy Through Region-Specific Models
## About the project
The primary aim is to develop highly accurate crop yield prediction models tailored to the specific characteristics of individual agricultural regions. By shifting the focus from broad-scale approaches to region-specific models, the goal is to provide farmers with precise forecasts that reflect the nuanced conditions of their local environment. This approach holds the potential to empower farmers with actionable insights for optimizing agricultural practices and improving productivity.

## How to run locally 
- Step 1: Clone the Repository

- Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Navigate into the directory where you cloned the repository.

- Step 3: Install Dependencies
npm install
This command will install all the dependencies required for your React application. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- Step 4: Start the Development Server
npm start
This command will start the development server for your React application. It will compile your code, launch a local server

- Step 5: Access Your Application

- Step 6: Make Changes and Experiment

- Step 7: Stop the Development Server
To stop the development server, you can simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal where it's running. This will halt the server and stop your React application from running locally.
  

# What's next ?
